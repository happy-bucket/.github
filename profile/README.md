### Our Mission is simple. ***Make the world a better place and help people out***.

#### **A little about us**

 Just as some background information, we started this as three 19 year olds from the UK looking to make a difference in the world. We first started the idea that became Happy Bucket back in January 2019 when we were originally thinking of a way to impact people who either needed help or just a little push in their day-to-day lives. At the time, we both had no experience in creating websites, making a business or even how to make a mobile app- but we had an idea. Over the next few months, we'd teach ourselves the essentials of building a website, a mobile app and a business. Here in February 2020, we're still going and we're determined to impact the world and nothing is going to stop us.

As stated, the goal is simple- we want to make a difference. If we can impact just a single person in a positive way, it's made our day. We've all heard "Life is short, live it to its fullest" and we couldn't agree more. Life is too short but the key to living a full life, is simply happiness itself. We all feel down and encounter issues in life, but it's how we tackle these issues. If we're knocked down, we get back up.
